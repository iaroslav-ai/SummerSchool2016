1.1 The most predictive features in order: Gender, Passanger class, Age. The rule of survival could be found by tracing the splits fo dataset with most survival cases from root node to leaves.

1.2 In our model we found that female passangers, whose passanger class is smaller than 3, and whose age is larger than 2 years, have estimated 95% probability of survival. Similarily we found that male passangers from the 2 class and larger of passangers who are older than 13 years and who payed less than 7.76 fare have only 13% chance of survival.

1.3 SibSp is useful In our model for predictions for male children from the 2 class and larger of passangers. The least usefull feature is the one that is used least of all; This is Parch.

1.4 There is a lot of overfitting going on in trees without pruning.
